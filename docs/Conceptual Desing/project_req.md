# Project Requirements: Office People Tracking System

## 1. Project Objectives
The project aims to develop a real-time people tracking system for an office environment using multiple cameras. The system must provide accurate location data of individuals and enforce room-based rules to ensure compliance with office policies. Additionally, a NAO robot will be integrated as an interactive element to enhance user engagement.

## 2. Essential Requirements
- The system must detect and track individuals within the office environment.
- The system must work across multiple rooms with different layouts and conditions.
- Each room must support customizable rules defining allowed behaviors.
- The NAO robot must serve as a medium for interaction with people.
- The robot must imitate gestures to enhance communication and engagement.
- The system must be compatible with ROS for seamless integration.
- The system must securely store real-time and historical location data.

- The system must provide real-time x, y location updates for each detected person.
- The system must monitor compliance with these rules.

## 3. Additional Requirements
- It must be able to provide notifications about rule violations in an engaging manner.
- The robot must control media systems when necessary.
- It must be capable of navigating within a room to interact with individuals.
- The NAO robot must be controllable through ROS, allowing commands for movement, media control, and interactive behaviors.
